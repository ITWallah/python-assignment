AI = artificial intelegence, perform its own task without Human interactions. example self driving cars,robots.

ML = machine learning, It is a subset of AI and it provides state tools to learn analyze visualize and develop predictive models from the data set. example amazon,netflix have recommendations.

DL = deep learning, It is a subset of ML. object detection Image recognition, chatbot,chatGPT.

DS = work in all.


#####
=> Types of ML:
1. supervised ML = dataset have output and model is to created by O/P. have category in data.
2. unsupervised ML 
3. SEMI SUPERVISED ML
4. rainforcasstment ml
 Supervised learning involves training the algorithm with labeled data, unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning involves training the algorithm to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. Examples of ML include spam filters, recommendation systems, and fraud detection systems.

#####
=> difference datasets:
1. training dataset : we will train the model.
2. Validation data set : tuning of model.
3. test : test the data accurecy.

ex = books(train ourself)-> Q&A -> train
ex = differenr books(train ourself)-> Q&A -> train
ex = direct exam papers -> test our brain -> output by result


##########
1. model performance : used for good high accurecy
2. overfitting and underfitting : 
   overfitting:
     train -> 95% acc up
     test  -> 65% acc down
     LOW BIAS AND HIGH VARIANCE(bias is for training and v.v.)
   underfitting:
     train -> 55% acc down
     test  -> 50% acc down
     HIGH BIAS AND LOW VARIANCE    
   Generalized model
     train -> 95% acc up
     test  -> 93% acc up
