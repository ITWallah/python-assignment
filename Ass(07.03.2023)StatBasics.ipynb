    "MEAN:\n",
    "Calculation: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and then dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The mean is sensitive to outliers, which are extreme values that can significantly affect the overall average.\n",

    "Calculation: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "Robustness: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. It provides a more accurate representation of the \"center\" of the data when outliers are present.\n",
    "Use: The median is useful when the data is skewed or when there are outliers that could distort the mean.\n",
    "Mode:\n",

    "MODE:\n",
    "Calculation: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "Use: The mode is used to identify the most common value in a dataset. It's particularly useful for categorical or discrete data.\n",

    "## answer 14:\n",
    "Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the overall pattern of a dataset. They can have a notable impact on measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range). The extent of this impact depends on the number of outliers, their values, and the nature of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects on Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can disproportionately influence the mean, especially in datasets with a small sample size. A single extreme value can significantly shift the mean towards that outlier's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is less affected by outliers than the mean. If there are outliers, the median may better represent the \"typical\" value because it is not as sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode may not be affected by outliers unless the dataset is multimodal (has multiple modes), in which case outliers might contribute to additional modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects on Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers tend to increase both the variance and standard deviation, as they contribute to larger squared differences from the mean. This increase occurs because the squared differences are being averaged, and larger deviations are squared and then summed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range, making it much wider or narrower depending on the direction of the outlier's deviation.\n",

    "Let's consider the following dataset representing the ages of a group of people in years:\n",

    "\n",
    "Median: The median without the outlier is 35, and with the outlier, it remains 35. The median is not influenced by the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Without the outlier, the variance and standard deviation would be relatively low. With the outlier, both values increase significantly due to the large squared difference between the outlier and the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the outlier (200) significantly affects the mean, variance, standard deviation, and range, while the median remains unchanged. This demonstrates the impact of outliers on various measures of central tendency and dispersion."
