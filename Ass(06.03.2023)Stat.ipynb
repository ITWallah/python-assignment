    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and describing data to provide a clear and concise overview of its main characteristics. These statistics do not involve making inferences about a larger population; rather, they focus on presenting the data in an easily understandable manner. Descriptive statistics help to organize and simplify data for interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Descriptive Statistics: Suppose you have collected data on the ages of individuals in a survey group. Descriptive statistics for this data might include measures such as the mean (average) age, the median (middle value), the mode (most frequent age), the range (difference between the maximum and minimum ages), and the standard deviation (a measure of how spread out the ages are from the average).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics provide a snapshot of the dataset's main features. They help in summarizing data for quick understanding and comparison. These statistics are often used in research, reporting, and general data presentation to convey basic information about the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involve drawing conclusions or making predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. These methods use probability theory and sampling techniques to estimate population parameters and assess the reliability of these estimates. Inferential statistics allow researchers to make generalizations beyond the observed sample and evaluate hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Inferential Statistics: Suppose you're a pollster conducting a political survey with a sample of 1000 voters. You want to estimate the proportion of the entire voting population that supports a certain candidate. You use inferential statistics to calculate a confidence interval for this proportion, indicating the range within which the true proportion likely falls.\n",

    "Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "Mode:\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",

    "Range:\n",
